The contents of the file /TradingViewWebhook/TradingViewWebhook/sounds/mid_up.wav should be an audio file. Since I cannot generate audio files directly, please ensure that you create or obtain the `mid_up.wav` file separately and place it in the specified directory. 

If you need help with creating the audio file or any other aspect of your project, feel free to ask!
